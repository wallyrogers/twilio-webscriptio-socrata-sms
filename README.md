Muliti-row SMS with Webscript.io to Mashup Twilio SMS &amp; Data.Oregon.gov json (socrata) &amp; google maps

Based on Justin Grimes but expanded. (https://github.com/justgrimes/mini-sms-app-example)
Created with help from Colin Spikes and his iteration of Justin's initial work documented here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yu_MPCJMy1w8JPzN_moKB0rsViKpdiD2UI4ylkdhkto/edit

Colin's nice documentation includes how to overcome several rookie setup stumbling blocks that were not covered 
in Justin's documentation.
